The 'One Click Accessibility' fork without the online account and GDPR implications of the Elementor version. Designed help you make your WordPress website more accessible, without sacrificing privacy.

This fork is looked after by jcx and is currently available online at https://jcx.life/oneclickaccessibility-2-fork

#### Why Fork?

I started this fork because OCA2 did everything I wanted it to, and Elementor have not only required an account to use their later changes, it also requires making additional changes to your terms and conditions to incorporate Elementor's processing of your user's data.

In my opinion, they bought or otherwise acquired a popular WordPress plugin and used it as a means to acquire more users for their service(s). I do not believe that an accessibility function should be tied into a separate entity's analytics and limited by page views or requests. For a time it also included Google Fonts, which is troublesome in the EU, though this may have changed in newer versions. The original, and this fork, do not.

Since the Elementor version still includes (what they call the 'Legacy' version) the original code which can be used until a site admin is nagged enough to upgrade and make an account, it was possible to backport the security fixes from it and refactor the code to match their "legacy" version, minus the extra namespace stuff they added to separate the module from their new version with anti-features.

I also added the OpenDyslexic font, a free font that makes things more readable for those with dyslexia. I just felt it was a better feature than the "readble font". I don't have dyslexia but I've heard from many people that say that the font being available is transformative to their experience.

I will do my best to keep the plugin updated, but this is the first proper fork I've managed so contributions and suggestions are welcome.

### Details

While most accessibility issues canâ€™t be addressed without directly changing your content, One Click Accessibility adds a number of helpful accessibility features with the minimum amount of setup and without the need for expert knowledge.

##### Accessibility Toolbar:

Add a toolbar toggling hat allows you to set:

* Resize font (increase/decrease)
* Grayscale
* Negative Contrast
* High Contrast
* Light Background
* Links Underline
* OpenDyslexic Font (OFL Licensed)
* Link to Sitemap / Feedback / Help pages

#### Accessibility Features:

* Enable skip to content
* Add outline focus for focusable elements
* Remove the target attribute from links
* Add landmark roles to all links
* Customizer for style adjustment

#### Other Features:
* No cloud account or connectivity required
* Doesn't use Google Fonts
* No updates to site terms and conditions required.
* Only cookies that are set are user preferences on interaction (to remember the mode) which is classified as "Functional Cookies", so should be GDPR compliant 

#### Contributions:

Would you like to contribute to One Click Accessibility? You are more than welcome to submit your requests, either on GitHub or on my own git infrastructure (once I get it up and running). :)

I'm still learning how to best handle running the fork, but issues and comments are open for feedback and PRs - just be nice to each other.
